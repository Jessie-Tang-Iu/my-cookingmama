## Project Title

My Cooking Mama

## Description

This is a web-based platform that allow user to log into their account and get access to their recipes. They can also filter the ingredients by checking out boxes to find what recipes that make.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Credits
This idea is come from my friend, Chloe. She has a problem on finding her recipe and feel frustrated when seeing the ingredients but has no idea on how to cook a meal. Therefore, this platform is created for people like her, to gather recipes and reduce the time on finding the right recipe. Hope that everyone can be their own cook!
